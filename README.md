# swarch - Software Architecture

Software architecture experiments sample application.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- JDK 21
- Maven 3
- Docker

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `io.lebin.swarch.Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell

```
